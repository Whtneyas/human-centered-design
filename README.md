# Human Centered Design ‚úçÔ∏è

## What is the Project? 
For this project we have to design for one specific person with a disability. The purpose of this project is to get deeper into the users and to learn how to test your designs. To test how your  well your specific person can use your design or product. I can achieve a better design  by prototyping and testing my design with this specific person.

### Live Demo üëÅÔ∏è

## Tester for my design:üßë‚Äçüíª

The tester for my design is Nicollette Besemer 


## User Scenario

### Who is  Nicollete Besemerüë©


Nicolette has limited use of her limbs. She uses a wheelchair to move around, and on her computer, she uses speech software and a drawing tablet instead of a mouse. This makes navigation difficult because she cannot use shortcuts. Nicolette is very involved in accessibility. In addition, she organizes a lot for the neighborhood and other volunteers. She used to be a geologist by profession and enjoys visiting natural wonders. She is also passionate about nature.


### What? 
Problem: Copy and paste Pasting‚úÇÔ∏èüìú
For her work, Nicolette reads and shares a lot of text pieces on, among other places, the website of the municipality. It is important to be able to extract the correct pieces and forward them. Without the right-click or shortcut keys, it is almost impossible to cut and paste. Nicollette wants a way to navigate, select, cut, and paste text using speech and a drawing tablet. Nicollette also want to be able to scroll through text easily.


### How? 

I want Nicollete to be able to select, copy and paste just with one click. Nicollette uses 80% percent of the time speech recognition. I think creating  a design that is not speech but a feature that is more helpful is something Nicollete would be glad to us. Let say she is at library reading books and then have to use the speech recognition. This can be a distraction to others in the library. I have created buttons which will help Nicollete to select , copy , and paste titles, paragraphs, and the whole section just by clicking o. For scrolling too i created a button that will serve as a scrolling effect for her and can be activated just with one click and also be stopped while scrolling in one click. With this solution Nicollete wouldn't have to long press on the buttons. All she has to do is press on the button to scroll and when she want to stop scroll press on the pauze button to stop scrolling.

Why? 
Because this webiste is specifically made for Nicollete. Eventhough , it is made for Nicollette but a lot of other people with the same disabilities as Nicollete will find this also useful.

### Questions for Nicollette Besemer‚ùî‚ùî

I sat with my group who also are to design for Nicollete to brainstorm on what ewe can do for Nicollette and also came up with questions we can ask Nicolletete during the interview so that we get a grasp of what we need to include in the deisgn and what not. 

1. What type of tablet are you currently using? 
1. After testing the product that we have made. What went well and what went bad. 
2. Why are you using a tablet and not a mouse? 
4. What are you able to do and what can't you do? . 
5. What type of files and apps do you use
6. Hoe gebruik je spraak op dit moment? 

### Possible solutions

So before i test my design with Nicollette i thought of some possible solutions to this problem. 

**Navigating- Voice command** üß≠

For navigating on the website the user can use voice commands to navigate through the text.For example, say "scroll up" or "scroll down" to  move through the document.

**Selecting** 
 Use the drawing tablet to select text. Draw a circle around the text you want to select, and then say "select" or "highlight." The selected text will be highlighted on the screen.

**Cutting**

 Draw a line through the selected text using the drawing tablet, and then say "cut" or "delete." The selected text will be removed from the document.

**Pasting**

 Move the cursor to the location where you want to paste the text, and then say "paste." The text you cut earlier will be inserted at the cursor location.


## Exclusive design principles üñ•Ô∏è

Exclusive designs are principles implemented when designing for people who are not mostly included when making designs example peopele with disabilitie. 



## Trials 

### Clipboard 
I  tried using the Clipboard api to try copying and pasting but unfortunately it didnt work cos the cliip api doesn't work old all browser and older browsers. I tried to experiment first in codepen before i work on it in Vscode:

## Testing 

 ###  Test 1 
  I made a simple web page with some design features to see how the user selects, copies and pastes text on their tablet, as I didn't know what kind of tablet they use or how they use it. I chose to make a nature-themed website because the user likes nature according to the project documentation, hoping that it would be more interesting and enjoyable for them.

 ### Testing with a tablet

I decided to borrow a tablet from my friend to test it myself since I haven't met Nicollette yet. I realized that selecting text with the tablet was annoying and didn't go as fast as I wanted it to. I also realized that I could only select one word but not a sentence. Additionally, I had to tap on the text with the pen two to three times before I could select a text.

## Testing with Nicollette. 

My team and i first had a discussion with her about the project and proceeded with asking the questions we prepared to ask her. One of the team member also brought a drawingtablet so that nicollette can test on it. 

### Answers for the questions

1. What type of tablet are you currently using? 

Answer: Nicollette didn't really remember the type of drawing tablet she has. So we had to mention the different brands of drawing tablets and finally got to know that she using **Wacom Tablet**


1. After testing the product that we have made. What went well and what went bad. 

Answer: She didn't like the fact that she has to click on a button to activate a speech recognition. She told us about how she puts on a speech recognition. She said she puts it's on in the morning and in the eveing she puts it off. She didn't like the fact that she has to always click a button when she wants to speak in the microfone or give instructions to the microfone.
  

2. Why are you using a tablet and not a mouse?

Answer: She said she cannot work with her nouse at all because it involves scrlling and clicking which she is unfortunately not able to do so uses basically a drawing tablet as a mousE. With the drawing tablet she has to hold the pen without clicking anything with her hands but rather use her pen. On the pen, are two buttons which can be used for selecting a text so she uses that.


3. What type of files and apps do you use üóÇÔ∏èüìë

Answer : She said she uses mostly word documents and she also selects folders en place them in other folders. Selcting of folders isn't something she finds difficult but having to select multiple folders and to scroll at the same time is what she finds difficult because she can't hold press the pen for long.

4. How do you currently use the speech recognition? üîä

Answer: She said she uses the speak recognition for almost everything. She uses it for scrolling, for sending text messages ect. For navigation she tries as much as possible to use the mouse. She also finds it uncomfortable to use the speech recognition in public places since it is going to get people's attention making people aorund her and herself feeling uncomfortable


### Insights üß†

After lsitening to her and having to make her take the test. I got to know a few things that i can implement in my next prototype

- She loves nature so i think it is advisable to make a website that is about nature 
- She works more with folders so i think making a website that require selecting and replacing folders.
- Copying without scrolling for long.
- She prefers reading in light mode than darkmode.
- She prefers the text being bigger cos she has a bad eye sight.
- Instructing with speech for scrolling left and right.
- Finding an easier way for her not to scroll for long.
- Enlarging the target touch point so that clicking of buttons become easier for her.



### Feedback- Eric'üìú
   My team and i sat with Eric to discuss how the test with Nicollette went. We all made known what are frustrations are. I , on the other hand also talked about how the test went and how i find it more difficult and confusing to find a better solution after the meeting with Nicollete. 
     
 ### Tips from Ericüîñ
   - Keeping our design simple.
   - It is more about your findings during every test but not the best solution. 
     
     
 
 
## Test 2 
During this week. I was finding it difficult ot think about a solution for Nicollette. The scrolling problem which Nicollete had came into mind   so i decided to create two buttons on my website which will help nicollette to easily scroll texts up and down. The button scrolls more paragraphs so that nicollete wouldn't have to press the buttons multiple of times. 

<img width="892" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Whtneyas/human-centered-design/assets/90154152/8a555c18-b334-4654-97ff-edd1af5a8284">
 
 
### Insights
- The scrolling effect was just a normal solution for her. But she wasn't really enthousiast about it
- She could easily use the buttons without any direction cos it was cleary stated to scroll up and down.
- She doesn't want to scroll for a long time 
- None of the speak recognition was working so i think it is better to try fix that part 
- She would like to be able to select a paragraph and not a whole text. 
- She is not really good in english so it is better to write the text in Dutch since it is her mother language



## Exclusive Design Principles

In my own words, I will define exclusive design as a principle or set of guidelines used to create products that are accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities or people with different needs. In this project, I am focusing on designing for a person with a disability. I believe I am applying exclusive design principles with my designs, as I am designing specifically for someone with a disability. This principle is going to help and guide me throughout my process.

*** 
### Study Situation

It is important to study the person you are designing for or creating a product for during the process. This is likely to be the first thing you have to do when designing a product. We have to first understand and study the people we are designing for. You cannot design for people with disabilities if you don't understand them and try to know the situation they are in. I was able to execute this principle by getting to know Nicollete and talking to her one-on-one. I observed how she uses speech recognition for sending messages. Eighty percent of the time, Nicollete relies on speech recognition for almost all her tasks when interacting with a device. She also finds it difficult to scroll for a long time. She mentioned that scrolling sometimes doesn't work for her. In my design, I implemented an easier scrolling effect that will help her to scroll easily without having to keep her finger fixated on her tablet for a long time. I added buttons that will allow her to scroll the text with just one click, and she can stop the scrolling with another click.

***

### Ignore Conventions

Normally, you copy and paste text using a keyboard and a mouse, which isn't the same for Nicollette. Nicollette uses her tablet for all navigations and copying and pasting text. She can also use her fingers on the keyboard, but she doesn't trust her fingers for that functionality. I decided to ignore anything related to the keyboard. I also disregarded the aesthetics of the website because I believe that having the functionality work is more important than creating a beautiful website that doesn't meet the necessary needs of the user or site visitor.

***

### Prioritise Identity

 After the first test with Nicollette  i realised she said she would love to copy and paste but she also made emphasis on being able to scroll easily without having to long press with her pen on the tablet which i understand het perfectly even people without her disability also gets tired when having to scroll for a long time. After the first test i started to think of the best solution for the scrolling problem she told us she would love if we could create an easier way for that.One thing i noticed about Nicollete was that selecting  a text was difficult and doesn't go as smoothly as she wants it to so i thought what if she can select, copy , and paste a text with just one click. In my last prototype i made a different buttons which select , copy and paste the tekst in a textfield just in one click 

***

### Add Nonsense
For the Add Nonsense principle i would want to add a feature that increases the size of the font. Nicollette made mention that she doesn;t have a good vision so i think it will be nice to add this feature . 



### Features 
1. Copying tekst with a button
2. Pasting tekst with a button 
3. Slecting tekst with a button 
4. Scrolling text with a button 
5. Stoppping the scrolling with a button 


### Wishlist 
1. Find a way to select specific random text with a button 
2. Selecting text with speech recognition . THAT WORKS PERFECTLY
3. Hightlight a specific tekst with a button or speech 
4. Implementing different speeds when scrolling. 


 ## Conclusie
 
 
 ### Testing 
 
 Testing with the user during the first stage of design really played a big role in identifyig the problems and coming up with better solution . Having the user test on your product openss new ideas for you and having to test in group also gives you inspirations to start with your design.

 ### Feedback
Feedback from the lectures also gave me insight on how to tackle certain issues and also my doubt towards ideas i had in mind for Nocollette. I was thinking to far and stressing on how to get a better solution for Nicollette but after the feedback with Eric . I got to know that it is now really about creating the toughest design or best solution but rather my findings during this project and my interations. 


### Exclusive Design principles 

The exclusive design principles of  Vasilis Hemert also played a big role in my journey through this project. I am very glad i was able to read this article before embarking on this project . I was able to get insights on what to expect before embarking on this project. I learnt to first study the user and how she behaves or interact with devices and also ......
